# Open Town Meeting

## Description

This is a full stack web app to help make Town Meeting easier to follow. Based off @cscott's ideas here: https://github.com/cscott/open-town-meeting/blob/main/NOTES.md

The website uses create-react-app and is deployed to Cloudflare Pages. Serverless functions are used for Firebase Authentication (log in with Google) and a graphql API. Data is stored in a Cloudflare D1 SQL database.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies with `npm ci`.

## Usage

Run the project locally with `npm run pages:dev`. This starts the development server at [http://localhost:8788](http://localhost:8788).

_TODO: Add info about how to set up a local database for testing._

## Contributing

I'm working on this myself for now, but hoping to open it up to contributions at some point.
